# ExcelCreator
Code that will quickly parse through a string with a set delimiter and then create a dictionary out of that string. It will also then create an Excel workbook with that dictionary. Uses openpyxl to create and modify the Excel document. Used to easily create Excel databases from government sites that do not have an option to download the databases and instead forces the user to copy and paste the data and format it into an Excel file. 

The program is still early on and still dosen't have a GUI to it. To change the string, the user will have to go into the code and change the variable with the string that they want to be parsed through.
